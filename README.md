# Bangalore Home Prices Prediction Website

This data science project series demonstrates how to build a real estate price prediction website. The project involves multiple stages, including model development, server implementation, and web interface creation.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will:

1. **Build a Model**: Develop a real estate price prediction model using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. We will use scikit-learn and linear regression for this purpose.
2. **Create a Flask Server**: Implement a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests and use the trained model to provide predictions.
3. **Develop a Web Interface**: Design and build a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface allows users to input home features such as square footage and number of bedrooms, and retrieve the predicted home price from the Flask server.

## Key Components

### 1. Model Building

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Identify and remove outliers to improve model accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create and select relevant features to enhance model performance.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply techniques to reduce the number of features if needed.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Employ k-fold cross-validation to assess model robustness.

### 2. Flask Server

- **Python Flask**: Create a server that serves HTTP requests and interacts with the trained model to provide predictions.

### 3. Web Interface

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Build a responsive and interactive web interface for user input and display of predictions.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Numpy and Pandas**: Libraries for data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Tool for data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Library for building and evaluating the machine learning model.
- **Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) used throughout the project.
- **Python Flask**: Framework for creating the web server.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Technologies for developing the front-end user interface.
